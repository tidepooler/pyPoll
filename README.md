# pyPoll
This project called "pyPoll" required some prework before coding could begin:

Inside my local git repository, I needed to create a directory called PyPoll.

Inside of this folder I, added the following:

A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files I used. 
I had to make sure the csv file had the correct path to the CSV file.
An "analysis" folder that contains my text file that has the results from my analysis.

Although the instructions indicated that I should include commits and push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab, I was told to ignore/not worry about the difficulties I was experiencing with communications between my computer and Github.

Therefore, I have uploaded only one folder for this project, which includes all my files.

Once the prework was completed as described above, I was required to complete the following steps for this project:

In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of "my company". I was provided with a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, "my company" has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset


The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


As an example, my analysis should look similar to the one below:
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

In addition, my final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
