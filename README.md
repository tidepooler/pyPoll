# pyPoll
This project called "pyPoll" required some prework before coding could begin:

Inside my local git repository, I needed to create a directory called PyPoll.

Inside of this folder I, added the following:

A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files I used. 
I had to make sure the csv file had the correct path to the CSV file.
An "analysis" folder that contains my text file that has the results from my analysis.

Although the instructions indicated that I should include commits and push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab, I was told to ignore/not worry about the difficulties I was experiencing with communications between my computer and Github.

Therefore, I have uploaded only one folder for this project, which includes all my files.
